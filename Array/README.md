# Array

An `array` stores values of the same type in an ordered list. The same value can appear in an array multiple times at different positions.

Here's how it would look
|Index|Value|
|-----|-----|
|0|Value 1|
|1|Value 2|

In Code it would look like this
```Swift

let shoppingList = ["Eggs","Milk"]
```
